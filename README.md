# 10000
Ten Thousand is a turn-based dice game. On your turn, you roll 6 dice and choose scoring combinations ("figures") from the result. You set aside the scoring dice and may continue rolling the remaining ones to try to increase your score.

If all 6 dice score, you can roll all of them again and keep going. However, if you roll and donâ€™t get any scoring dice, you lose all points from that turn, and it's the next player's turn.

The first player to reach 10,000 points wins!
